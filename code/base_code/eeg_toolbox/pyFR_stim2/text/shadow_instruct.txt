In this study, words will appear on the computer screen.  As each word is shown please say it aloud and try to picture it in your mind. Do not try to think back to other words in the list.

After the last word in each list, numbers will appear on the screen. As each number is shown please say it aloud. After the last number, you will see a row of asterisks (*******) flash on the screen and you will hear a tone.  At this time, say as many words as you can remember from the list, IN ANY ORDER.  Speak loudly and clearly. Please try hard throughout the recall period, as you may recall some words even when you feel you have exhausted your memory.
